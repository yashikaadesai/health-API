# health-API

##### This mini,simple,practice project demonstrates an RESTful API designed to simulate how AI can enhance project management workflows through automated health assessments.

Leveraging FastAPI for API architecture and TextBlob for lightweight NLP sentiment analysis, the system evaluates simulated project data — including task progress, team activity, and communication logs — to determine a project's overall health status.
